                            Is my high school going to help me prepare for SAT/ACT?

                                Most schools don't have classes allocated just for SAT/ACT prep. I know some schools have clubs for SAT/ACT prep. The high school that I attended didn't have anything like that
                                You are expected to self-prepare for them. However, there are many free/paid test prep courses online.

                           Back in India, my school had final exams that covered the entire syllabus. Are AP exams like those final exams? Do they get counted towards my GPA?

                               They are kind of like final exams (they cover the entire syllabus); however, your school wont conduct them. 
                               College board conducts AP exams every year. <br>
                               AP exams DO NOT count towards your GPA. Students take AP exams to get college credit and show colleges that they are
                               capable of college-level courses.

                            I watched many high school related movies on Netflix. I am overwhelmed by how they portray American High Schools.
                            Is it really like that?

                               Shows/movies tend to exaggerate small events that happen in high school. Trust me...students are more focused 
                               on studies than trying to be the most popular person at school. Atleast at my high school, people focused more on grades
                               school than on social events like prom, homecoming, etc. This does vary from school to school. Overall, I feel that Netlfix movies 
                               make American High School look like a party. School here is very balanced; don't get too overwhelmed...I am sure you will be just fine :)
