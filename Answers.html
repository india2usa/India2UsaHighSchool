                            Is my high school going to help me prepare for SAT/ACT?

                                Most schools don't have classes allocated just for SAT/ACT prep. I know some schools have clubs for SAT/ACT prep. The high school that I attended didn't have anything like that
                                You are expected to self-prepare for them. However, there are many free/paid test prep courses online.

                           Back in India, my school had final exams that covered the entire syllabus. Are AP exams like those final exams? Do they get counted towards my GPA?

                               They are kind of like final exams (they cover the entire syllabus); however, your school wont conduct them. 
                               College board conducts AP exams every year. <br>
                               AP exams DO NOT count towards your GPA. Students take AP exams to get college credit and show colleges that they are
                               capable of college-level courses.

                            I watched many high school related movies on Netflix. I am overwhelmed by how they portray American High Schools.
                            Is it really like that?

                               Shows/movies tend to exaggerate small events that happen in high school. Trust me...students are more focused 
                               on studies than trying to be the most popular person at school. Atleast at my high school, people focused more on grades
                               school than on social events like prom, homecoming, etc. This does vary from school to school. Overall, I feel that Netlfix movies 
                               make American High School look like a party. School here is very balanced; don't get too overwhelmed...I am sure you will be just fine :)

                               Your school counsellor will help you do that. My school had a course selection sheet to choose courses from. 
                               It is important to note that every school has a different procedure. Back in India, we used to have the same courses 
                               as our classmates. Here, you get to choose from a wide variety of classes (the courses available 
                               depends on the school you go to). I hope I answer your question :)

                               from selecting course to getting ready to graduate. Make sure to ask clarify 
                               school-specific doubts with them.

                               Sorry if I sound like a broken record, but this depends on your school here and in India. Some of my friends who moved from India, 
                               had their grades and credit counted others had only credit counted. There is also another case: IB. 
                               I am not fully aware of how IB works, but I think transferring credits is easier for IB students.

                               If your school accepts your foreign language credits…you are good to go! Each school has different requirements 
                               for foregin language (FL) credits to graduate. Usually it is 2-3 credits of the same forgein language. 
                               At my school, CS was counted as a language credit. Be sure to check that with your high school counsellor. 
                               For me, they accepted one FL credit but I had to take an OPI (Oral Proficiency Interview) for the second credit. 
                               I passed the interview and earned my FL credit and reached my school’s FL graduation requirement.

                               Nope. College dont use 10th grade PSAT. The PSAT you take in 11th grade is the important one: 
                               this one can qualify you for the National Merit Scholarship Program which is my 11th grade PSAT 
                               can also be referred to NMSQT. Qualifying for NMSQT is a great achievement and looks good on college apps.
